# 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

# 代码实现

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count=0;
        while (n!=0){
            if((n&0x1)!=0){
                count++;
            }
            n>>>=1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

# 分析对比

思路：每次把最低位的1变成0

代码实现：

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        sum++;
        n &= (n - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}
```
