# 414. Third Maximum Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

Example 1:

```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

# 代码实现

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Integer first,second,third;
        first=second=third=null;
        for(Integer num : nums){
            if(num.equals(first)||num.equals(second)||num.equals(third)){
                continue;
            }
            if(first==null||num>first){
                third=second;
                second=first;
                first=num;
            }else if(second==null||num>second){
                third=second;
                second=num;
            }else if(third==null||num>third){
                third=num;
            }
        }
        return third==null ? first : third;
    }
}
```
