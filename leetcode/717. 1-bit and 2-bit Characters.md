# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

Example 1:

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```

Note:

- 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
- bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

# 我的思路

题中明确说明最后一位为0

以[1,0,0]为例，只要保证前leng-1中有m个10,n个11,k个0，并且有
2*m+2*n+k+1==length

# 代码实现

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int count1=0,count2=0,count3=0;
        for(int i=0;i<bits.length-1;){
            if(bits[i]==1) {
                if(bits[i+1]==0) {
                    count1++;
                }else{
                    count2++;
                }
                i+=2;
            }else {
                count3++;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return (2*count1+2*count2+count3+1)==bits.length;
    }
}
```

# 分析对比

核心思路和我的应该是一样的，不同的是最终的判断并不是以数组长度，而是跳出循环的索引来进行判断，更聪明。

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int n = bits.length, i = 0;
        while (i < n - 1) {
            if (bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i += 2;
        }
        return i == n - 1;
    }
}
```
