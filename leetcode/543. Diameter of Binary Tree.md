# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree 

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# 我的思路

1. 根节点深度=max(左子树深度，右子树深度)+1
2. 根节点路径=根节点深度-1;

# 代码实现

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    int diameter;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null){
            return 0;
        }
        deep(root);
        return diameter;
    }
    private int deep(TreeNode node){
        if(node==null){
            return 0;
        }
        int leftDeep=deep(node.left);
        int rightDeep=deep(node.right);
        //leftDeep+rightDeep+1-1;
        diameter=Math.max(diameter,leftDeep+rightDeep);
        return Math.max(leftDeep,rightDeep)+1;
    }
}
```
